## Interactive Machine Learning Generative Art Tool üöÄ

This project used a stable diffusion model to develop a Web User Interface for individuals that lacked any technical background. The project involves designing a 3D Virtual Gallery for users that lack technology backgrounds. This project is past the sketching and wireframe prototyping phases. It is at its feasibility stage, whereby are testing certain aspects which will be included at an advanced phase of the design procedure. 

The Web UI in the feasibility prototype was meant to allow end-users to upload their profile pictures and generate new images with different styles by using a prompt. The generated image was uploaded to a 3D virtual gallery manually. The web User Interface enabled end-users to create images from text. This tool is projected to be affordable and give end users free points. The end-users are also given free classifier guidance to enable them to obtain the most interesting results.

The higher the number of steps used for every produced image, the slower the generation and the higher the quality. However, users will be cautioned against overusing this parameter since, after a maximum point of increasing steps, no result will be achieved. The interface will also involve using the same seed to regenerate an image and an alternative or random seed to create new images. To improve the results achieved from this project, a user should write precise descriptions and specify the image style.
